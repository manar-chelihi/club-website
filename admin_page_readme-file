Notes & limitations Data is stored in the browser only (per device and per browser). Clearing site data or localStorage removes everything.
Do not store sensitive data (passwords, tokens) in localStorage. This is a client-side demo; for multi-user persistence or security, add a backend
API and proper auth. Responsive & accessibility notes The layout uses a sidebar and a main area. Media queries adapt the sidebar and layout on smaller screens. 
Tables are adjusted for mobile; layout can be improved further (e.g. accessible table markup or card view on small screens). 
Troubleshooting If data doesn't persist: Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console: look for errors.
Check localStorage (Application tab in DevTools) to confirm keys exist. If JavaScript stops working: Look for console errors such as "Cannot read property ... of null" — usually means an element ID/class in HTML doesn't match the JS selector. Development tips Use a feature branch, commit changes, and open a Pull Request before merging to main.
